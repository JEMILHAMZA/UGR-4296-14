        <h2> MY HOBBIES</h2>
        <p>My diverse range of hobbies, including coding, fitness, football, involvement in my school community club,
            photography, and reading fiction, provide me with opportunities for personal growth, self-expression, and
            the pursuit of my passions. Each hobby allows me to explore different aspects of my interests, challenge
            myself, and find fulfillment in various dimensions of my life.</p>

                    <p><strong>programming</strong></p>
                    <p>One of my greatest passions is coding, where I immerse myself in the world of programming
                        languages and software development. Through coding, I can bring ideas to life, solve complex
                        problems, and create innovative solutions. It provides me with a sense of accomplishment and
                        fuels my desire to continuously expand my technical skills.</p>

                    <p><strong>foot ball</strong></p>
                    <p>Football has always held a special place in my heart. The thrill of the game, teamwork, and the
                        pursuit of victory make it an exhilarating hobby. Being part of a football team not only hones
                        my athletic abilities but also fosters camaraderie and teaches me valuable lessons in
                        collaboration, leadership, and resilience.</p>

                    <p><strong>physical fitness</strong></p>
                    <p>I am a dedicated fitness enthusiast. Engaging in physical activities and maintaining a healthy
                        lifestyle is essential to me. Whether it's hitting the gym, going for a run, or practicing yoga,
                        fitness allows me to stay active, relieve stress, and maintain overall well-being. The
                        discipline and perseverance required in fitness mirror the same qualities I apply in other areas
                        of my life.</p>

                    <p><strong>fiction reading</strong></p>
                    <p>I find solace and inspiration in the world of fiction through reading. Immersing myself in the
                        pages of a captivating novel allows me to escape reality, explore different worlds, and gain new
                        insights. Reading fiction broadens my imagination, enhances my critical thinking skills, and
                        transports me to realms of endless possibilities.</p>

                        through visual imagery. Whether it's nature, portraits, or capturing candid moments, photography
                        enables me to express my creativity and share my unique perspective with others. It is a hobby
                        that constantly challenges me to see the world from different angles and appreciate the beauty
